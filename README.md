# Hermeto integration tests repository

This repository hosts the integration tests for our project. Each branch represents a different test
case. Please ignore README.md files in those branches at the moment. They might not be up to date.

The branch names begin with a prefix indicating a package manager, followed by the
test case name in the format: `<package-manager>/<test-case>`.
