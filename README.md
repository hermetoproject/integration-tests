# Cachi2 integration tests repository

This repository hosts the integration tests for the Cachi2 project. Each branch
represents a different test case. Please ignore README.md files in those branches
at the moment. They might not be up to date.

The branch names begin with a prefix indicating a package manager, followed by the
test case name in the format: `<package-manager>/<test-case>`.

To create a new test please create or request a new branch in GitHub UI first
and then open a PR against this branch. Alternatively, you can push an empty
branch first if you have push rights. Please avoid pushing non-empty branches
since that would hinder the visibility of changes made to this repository in
context of the main project repository.
